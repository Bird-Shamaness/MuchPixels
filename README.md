Hot to start the app
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Wait forever

# Or, if you prefer to use `yarn` instead of `npm`
yarn install

# Start MongoDb service

# Then start the app
node app.js

# Or
npm start
```
