 How to start the app
 ----------------
 The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:
 
 ```bash
 # Change directory
 cd Pixels
 
 # Install NPM dependencies
 npm install
 
 # Wait forever
 
 # Or, if you prefer to use `yarn` instead of `npm`
 yarn install
 
 # Start MongoDb service
 
 # Then start the app
 node app.js
 
# Or
 npm start
 ```
